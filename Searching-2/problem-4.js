/*
You are given three positive integers, A, B, and C.

Any positive integer is magical if divisible by either B or C.

Return the Ath smallest magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return modulo 109 + 7.

Note: Ensure to prevent integer overflow while calculating.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109

2 <= B, C <= 40000
